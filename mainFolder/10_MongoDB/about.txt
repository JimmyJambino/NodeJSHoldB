mongodb is a document database, non-relational
watch paradigm video
we can just give json to mongodb and save it, and retrieve it as well.
^works really nice with web servers that understand json (many, like in nodejs)

jsonSchema vs ODM

mongoDB keywords: db.<table>.keyword() ==> db.tutorials.insert({bla bla}) ==> db.tutorials.insert({"name": "jimmy", "id": 2})
C - insert() ==> (there is no concept of primary key, so it needs to be handled by the programmer in the code.)
R - find() ==> all
    find({channel: "nameX"}) finds rows with the value nameX
U - update({where}, {what}) ==>  update({channelName: "How to Basic"}, {"viewCounter: 10000}) ==> replaces channelName with viewCounter
    update({where}, {$set: {what}}) ==> ..{$set: {viewCounter: 10000}}) ==> updates properly, and possibly adds the set variable.
D - deleteOne() ==> deletes one row, the first found(by _id) with the same syntax as find()
    deleteMany() ==> deletes all found
    remove() ==> Same as above


    npm init -y
    npm i mongodb
    
remember to run db or i wont work.
